# ðŸ”§ Storage Key Fix Summary

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Issue:** Home, Sender, and Calendar pages not showing emails after Dashboard classification

## Root Cause

Dashboard was saving emails to `localStorage.appCache.classifiedEmailsMap`, but:
- **Home page** was filtering correctly but had overly strict date matching
- **Sender page** was reading from old `classifiedEmails` key
- **Calendar page** was reading from old `classifiedEmails` key

## Changes Made

### 1. âœ… SenderPage.js
**Problem:** Only read from legacy `classifiedEmails` key  
**Fix:** Now reads from all three sources in priority order:
```javascript
1. appCache.classifiedEmailsMap (primary)
2. classifiedEmailsMap (legacy map)
3. classifiedEmails (legacy array)
```

### 2. âœ… CalendarPage.js
**Problem:** Only read from legacy `classifiedEmails` key  
**Fix:** Now reads from all three sources in priority order (same as Sender)

### 3. âœ… Home.js
**Problem:** Date filtering was working but needed debugging visibility  
**Fix:** 
- Added console logging to trace data flow
- Logs total emails loaded, today's date, and filtered count
- Simplified date comparison logic

### 4. âœ… Dashboard.js
**Already correct** - Properly saves to `appCache.classifiedEmailsMap` and stamps `receivedAt` field

## Storage Structure

### Primary (Current)
```javascript
localStorage.appCache = {
  classifiedEmailsMap: {
    "email_id_1": {
      id: "email_id_1",
      date: "2025-10-19",        // YYYY-MM-DD from backend
      receivedAt: 1729324800000, // ms timestamp (fallback)
      sender: "sender@example.com",
      subject: "...",
      body: "...",
      categories: ["Work", "Information"]
    },
    "email_id_2": { ... }
  }
}
```

### Legacy (Fallback)
```javascript
// Map format
localStorage.classifiedEmailsMap = { "email_id": {...}, ... }

// Array format
localStorage.classifiedEmails = [ {...}, {...}, ... ]
```

## Date Field Priority

Home page checks date fields in this order:
1. `email.date` (primary - backend returns YYYY-MM-DD)
2. `email.receivedAt` (fallback - set by Dashboard/Home)

## Testing Steps

### 1. Debug Storage
Visit: **http://localhost:3000/debug-storage.html**
- Shows all localStorage keys
- Displays email counts
- Shows sample email structure

### 2. Test Flow
1. **Dashboard** â†’ Click "Fetch & Classify Gmail"
2. Wait for classification (progress bar)
3. **Home** â†’ Should show today's emails grouped by category
4. **Senders** â†’ Should show all emails grouped by sender
5. **Calendar** â†’ Should show emails on calendar dates

### 3. Console Logs (Home Page)
Open browser DevTools Console to see:
```
[Home] Total emails loaded: 15
[Home] Today string: 2025-10-19
[Home] Sample email date: 2025-10-19
[Home] Today emails filtered: 15
```

## Expected Behavior

### Home Page
- Shows **only today's emails** (date === current date)
- Groups by category with collapsible sections
- Shows stats: total today, unread, top category
- "Refresh Emails" button fetches new from Gmail

### Sender Page
- Shows **all classified emails** grouped by sender
- Search box to filter senders
- Click sender to see their emails
- Avatar circles with sender initials

### Calendar Page
- Shows **all classified emails** on calendar
- Date badges show count per day
- Click date to see emails in modal
- Current day highlighted with glow

### Dashboard Page
- Shows **all classified emails**
- Filter by category
- Fetch & Classify button
- Progress bar during classification
- Top Senders sidebar
- Recent Activity stats

## Troubleshooting

### If Home shows "No emails from today yet"
1. Check Dashboard - do emails show there?
2. Open debug page: http://localhost:3000/debug-storage.html
3. Check console logs for date mismatch
4. Verify email.date field matches today: `2025-10-19`

### If Sender/Calendar show no emails
1. Check Dashboard - do emails show there?
2. Open debug page to verify localStorage has data
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Try clearing localStorage and re-fetching

### Clear All Data
1. Visit: http://localhost:3000/debug-storage.html
2. Click "Clear All Storage"
3. Log in again and fetch emails

## Files Modified

1. âœ… `frontend/src/pages/Home.js` - Added logging, kept today filter
2. âœ… `frontend/src/pages/SenderPage.js` - Read from appCache + fallbacks
3. âœ… `frontend/src/pages/CalendarPage.js` - Read from appCache + fallbacks
4. âœ… `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.js` - Already correct (stamps receivedAt)
5. âœ… `frontend/public/debug-storage.html` - NEW debug tool

## No Changes Required

- âœ… Backend (main.py, gmail_helpers.py) - Already returns correct date format
- âœ… EmailCard.js - Works with any email shape
- âœ… Navbar.js - Not affected
- âœ… App.js - Not affected

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Dashboard shows all classified emails
- [ ] Home shows only today's emails with categories
- [ ] Sender shows all emails grouped by sender
- [ ] Calendar shows emails on correct dates
- [ ] Debug page shows email count > 0
- [ ] Console logs show correct filtering
- [ ] No errors in browser console
